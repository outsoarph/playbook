## Guides

### Text Content

We as a development team aiming 99.9% accuracy, we should responsible for the encoding properly the text content. Consider the following:

1. Grammar and Spelling
2. Capitalization
3. Punctuation and Symbols
   
If there are some grammatical errors or spelling errors. We should notify the content writer or the client about it. Corrections should be made by the content writer or the client. Our job is to notify them about the errors and implement the corrections.

For spelling errors, we can use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to check the spelling errors.

### SEO

As a developer, we should be aware of the SEO best practices. We should be able to implement the SEO best practices in the website.

**1. Meta Tags**

1. Title Tag `<title>...</title>`
2. Meta Description `<meta name="description" content="...">`
3. Meta Keywords `<meta name="keywords" content="...">`
4. Meta Robots `<meta name="robots" content="...">`
5. Meta Viewport `<meta name="viewport" content="...">`
6. Meta Charset `<meta charset="...">`
7. Meta Author `<meta name="author" content="...">`
8. Open Graph Tags `<meta property="og:..." content="...">`
9. Twitter Card Tags `<meta name="twitter:..." content="...">`

Tools might use to check the title tag and meta description: 

1. [opengraph.xyz](https://www.opengraph.xyz/)
2. [metatags.io](https://metatags.io/)

As a developer, we should be able to implement the meta tags properly. We should be able to check the meta tags if they are implemented properly. Usually, the meta tags are implemented in the `head` tag of the HTML document.

**Notes**
1. The tags should be loaded during the initial page load. Tags loaded dynamically using JavaScript will not be indexed by search engines.
2. Keywords meta tag is not used by search engines anymore. It is not recommended to use the keywords meta tag.

**2. Heading Tags ( h1, h2, h3 ...h6)**

Heading tags should be used properly. 

1. The `h1` tag should be used only once per page. 
2. The `h2` tag should be used for subheadings. The `h3` tag should be used for subheadings of the `h2` tag and so on. As musch as possible the heading tags should be used in order
3. `h1`-`h6` tags should be used for headings only. They should not be used for styling purposes.
4. `h1`-`h6` must only have text content. They should not contain images or other elements as much as possible.
   
5. **Image Alt Tags ( alt="..." )**
  
Image alt tags should be used properly. The image alt tags should be descriptive and should be relevant to the image.

4. Internal Linking

Should be able to implement internal linking properly. Internal linking is the process of linking one page to another page within the same website. Internal linking helps search engines to crawl and index the website properly.

5. External Linking

Should be able to implement external linking properly. External linking is the process of linking one page to another page outside the website. 

Sample of external linking:

```html
<a target="_blank"
  href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide"
  rel="noreferrer">
  Goole Seo Guide
</a>
```

Note that the `target="_blank"` attribute is used to open the link in a new tab. The `rel="noreferrer"` attribute is used to prevent the referrer information from being sent to the linked page.

### WebPerf

WebPerf known as *"Web Performance"* is the process of optimizing the performance of a website. The goal of web performance is to improve the user experience of a website by making it load faster.

Tools use to check the web performance:
- [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
- [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/)

- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)
- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
- [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
- [Siteimprove](https://siteimprove.com/en-us/)
- [Tenon](https://tenon.io/)

### Design

As a developer, we should be able to implement the design properly. We should be able to implement the design as close as possible to the design mockup.  

### Testing

As a developer, we should be able to test the website properly. We should be able to test the website in different browsers and devices. We should be able to test the website in different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

Tools use to check the design in different screen sizes:
- [Responsively](https://responsively.app/) 
- [Lambdatest Browser](https://www.lambdatest.com/lt-browser)
