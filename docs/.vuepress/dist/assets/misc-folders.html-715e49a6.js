While there isn&#39;t a strict convention regarding their usage, here&#39;s a general understanding of the differences between these folders:</p><ol><li><p><code>Support</code> folder: The <code>Support</code> folder is often used to store classes or files that provide support functionality or services for the application. It can contain various utility classes, traits, or service classes that assist in specific tasks. These classes might provide reusable methods or encapsulate complex logic that is used across different parts of the application. The <code>Support</code> folder is commonly used when the functionality doesn&#39;t fit into more specific folders like <code>Models</code>, <code>Controllers</code>, or <code>Services</code>.</p></li><li><p><code>Utils</code> folder: The <code>Utils</code> folder (short for &quot;utilities&quot;) typically contains classes or files that provide general-purpose utility functions or helpers. These utility classes often encapsulate common functionality that can be reused throughout the application. They may include functions for data manipulation, string formatting, file handling, date/time operations, or any other general-purpose operations. The <code>Utils</code> folder aims to centralize and organize these utility classes in one location, making it easier to locate and use them when needed.</p></li><li><p><code>Helpers</code> folder: The <code>Helpers</code> folder is commonly used to store standalone helper functions or files that provide convenient functions that can be used globally throughout the application. Helper functions are typically defined as PHP functions and are not tied to a specific class or object. They are often used for simple tasks or operations that are frequently needed across different parts of the application. Laravel allows you to autoload helper files placed in this folder automatically, making the helper functions easily accessible throughout the application.</p></li></ol><p>It&#39;s worth mentioning that the specific usage and organization of these folders can vary based on the preferences and conventions of the development team. It&#39;s a good practice to keep the purpose of each folder clear and consistent within your application to maintain code readability and organization.</p>",3),n=[a];function r(c,l){return o(),t("div",null,n)}const p=e(s,[["render",r],["__file","misc-folders.html.vue"]]);export{p as default};
