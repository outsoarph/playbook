## Welcome

Kumusta! :wave: 

Visitors, welcome to the Outsoar Playbook. This is a living document that outlines the processes, policies, procedures, and best practices in tech and management that govern how we work at Outsoar. 

We are aiming to make this guide a helpful resource for everyone at Outsoar and our clients. 

This playbook in clients perspective is like a manual for our service and how we work.  

## Audiences

**Clients** - who are interested to see how we work and what we can do. 

**Coworker** - our team members who are looking for a reference on how to do things. They are also contributors to this playbook.
 
**Visitors** - maybe a developer or a designer who is interested in how we work and what we do.
