# AWS 

Managing cloud infrastructure on AWS involves a diverse set of services and best practices. At Outsoar PH, we adhere to industry standards and guidelines to architect robust and scalable solutions on AWS. This document serves as a guide to understanding our AWS architecture principles.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, it's important to have a basic understanding of cloud computing concepts and familiarity with AWS services. If you're new to AWS, we recommend exploring the following resources:

- [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)
- [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
- [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) (optional)

## Our AWS Architecture Principles

- **Scalability**: Our architecture is designed to scale seamlessly to accommodate fluctuating workloads and growing demands.
- **Reliability**: We prioritize high availability and fault tolerance to ensure consistent performance and uptime.
- **Security**: Security is at the core of our architecture. We implement robust security measures to protect data and resources.
- **Cost Optimization**: We optimize costs by leveraging AWS services efficiently and implementing cost-saving strategies without compromising performance or security.
- **Automation**: Automation is key to streamlining operations and reducing manual intervention. We embrace infrastructure as code (IaC) and automation tools to provision, configure, and manage resources.
- **Performance**: We focus on optimizing performance at every layer of the architecture, from compute and storage to networking and database services.
