## Introduction

Since we are entering new phase of leadership and development. We need to establish a new process for development. Determine our capacity and role in our team. We will use Hybrid Scrum as our development process. Since we are small team, we will not follow all the rules of Scrum. We will only follow the rules that are applicable to our team.

## Definitions 

**Scrum** - Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

**Scrum Master** - The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.

**Product Owner** - The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

**Development Team** - The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.

**Sprint** - A Sprint is a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

**Sprint Planning** - The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

**Sprint Goal** - The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.

**Sprint Backlog** - The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality into a "Done" Increment.

**Daily Scrum** - The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. This is done by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting the work that could be done before the next one.

## Role
1. **Mayai Representative** as Product Owner
2. **Masato-san** as Scrum Master
3. **Ringing Team** as Development Team
4. **Mayai CS Team** as Quality Assurance
   
## Goal

To be agile and to have a defined process for development.

## Proposed Solution

We would like to propose to use Scrum as our development process.

## High Level Process

1. Product Owner will create a ticket in Github Project Board. The ticket will be added to the backlog. 
2. Scum Master will determine the capacity of the team. 
3. Scrum Master will facilitate the sprint planning. Together with the Product Owner, Scrum Master will select the ticket from the backlog and add it to the sprint.
4. Scrum Master will facilitate the daily scrum.
5. Scrum Master will facilitate the sprint review.
6. Scrum Master will facilitate the sprint retrospective.


## Sprint Board Columns

1. Backlog - This is where the tickets will be added by the Product Owner.
2. To Do - This is where the tickets will be added by the Scrum Master during the sprint planning.
3. In Progress - This is where the tickets will be added by the Development Team during the sprint.
4. Review - This is where the tickets will be added by the Development Team during the sprint.
5. UAT - This is where the tickets will be added by the Quality Assurance during the sprint.
6. Done - This is where the tickets will be added by the Product Owner during the sprint review.

## Ticket Requirements
- Title
- Description
- Acceptance Criteria
- Labels (Ticket Type, Ticket Estimation, Ticket Priority)

## Ticket Types

- Epic - An epic is a story that is too big to fit in a single sprint. It needs to be broken down into smaller stories.
- Feature - A feature is a functionality that is visible to the end user.
- Bug - A bug is a problem which impairs or prevents the functions of the product.
- Chore - A chore is work that is technical in nature and has no direct value to the end user. Examples of chores could be: “Setup CI server”, “Clean up test data”, “Refactor module X”, etc.
- Spike - A spike is a story whose purpose is to gain the knowledge necessary to reduce the risk of a technical approach, better understand a requirement, or increase the reliability of a story estimate.

## Ticket Estimation

Ticket estimation is based on "Gut Feeling". The team will estimate the ticket based on the following:

- 1 - Easy. Trivial work such as changing the color of the button. 
- 2 - Medium. Less logic but sometimes requires research. Sometimes easy but too many steps.
- 3 - Hard. Requires research and logic. Requires multiple steps. 
- 5 - Very Hard. Requires consultation with other team members. Requires multiple steps. 
- 8 - Extremely Hard. Unknown yet. Requires multiple steps. 
- 13 - Impossible. Very unknown. Requires multiple steps.

## Ticket Prioritization

Ticket prioritization is based on the following:

- Highiest - The ticket is blocking the development.
- High - The ticket is blocking the development but there is a workaround.
- Medium - The ticket is not blocking the development but it is important.
- Low - The ticket is not blocking the development and it is not important.
- Lowest - The ticket is not blocking the development and it is not important.
