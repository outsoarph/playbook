# Handling Website Downtime

**Team:**

- **Point of Contact:** Marlon Galicia
- **Holidays Skeleton Team:** Ashley Solomon, Jayr, Tyzer
- **Normal Days:** Marlon and the entire team

**Workflow Process:**

1. **Emergency Submission:** When a website emergency occurs outside of normal working hours on holidays or weekends, the issue should be reported through the designated emergency channel (e.g., a dedicated email address or a communication platform like Slack).

2. **Initial Triage (Holidays Skeleton Team):** The holidays skeleton team (Ashley Solomon, Jayr, Tyzer) will be responsible for initial triage of the issue. They will monitor the emergency channel during their scheduled shifts.

3. **Notification:** If any of the holidays skeleton team members receive an emergency notification, they must immediately acknowledge it and begin investigating the issue.

4. **Assessment:** The holidays skeleton team will assess the severity of the issue. If it's a critical error or a website down situation, they will escalate it as a high-priority incident.

5. **Immediate Action:** Depending on the severity, the holidays skeleton team will take immediate action to resolve the issue or, at the very least, stabilize the situation. This may involve rollback procedures, server restarts, or other critical actions.

6. **Communication:** The holidays skeleton team will maintain clear communication within their team and with Marlon, the point of contact, regarding the progress of the resolution efforts.

7. **Escalation (if needed):** If the issue cannot be resolved by the holidays skeleton team or requires additional expertise, they will escalate it to Marlon and provide all relevant details.

8. **Marlon's Involvement:** Marlon, as the point of contact, will be on standby during holidays and weekends to assist with critical issues if needed. He will also be responsible for making decisions regarding further escalation, involving additional team members, or engaging external resources.

9. **Regular Updates:** Throughout the incident resolution process, the team will provide regular updates on progress, expected resolution times, and any changes in the situation.

10. **Documentation:** Detailed documentation of the incident, including what actions were taken and their outcomes, will be maintained for post-incident analysis and reporting.

11. **Resolution and Follow-Up:** Once the issue is resolved or stabilized, the holidays skeleton team will communicate the resolution to the concerned parties and ensure that the website is back to normal operation.

12. **Handover (Normal Days):** When normal working hours resume, Marlon will take over incident management responsibilities from the holidays skeleton team. He will ensure that any lingering issues are fully addressed and conduct a post-incident review to identify root causes and preventive measures.

This workflow process ensures that website emergencies are promptly addressed, even during holidays and weekends. It also maintains clear communication channels and responsibilities for different team members to ensure effective incident management.
