## Our Frontend Manifesto

- **User-First Approach**: Our development process prioritizes the user, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience.
- **Performance Over Flourishes**: Performance takes precedence over aesthetic design. We strive for fast, responsive applications.
- **Accessibility**: Our applications are accessible to all, adhering to [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) guidelines to ensure broad usability.
- **Security**: We commit to making our applications secure by following industry-leading security practices.
- **Developer Experience**: We ensure a positive developer experience, regardless of the framework or library. We believe that a productive developer leads to better applications and lower costs.
- **No Bias**: We are framework-agnostic. We choose the right tool for the job, not the most popular one.
