## Introduction

At Outsoar, we believe that creating software is a team endeavor. In the intricate world of coding, designing, and problem-solving, collaboration is not just beneficialâ€”it's essential. It's the magic ingredient that propels us toward remarkable achievements. That's why choosing and familiarizing ourselves with tools that enhance our collaborative efforts is crucial. We at Outsoar utilize [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and [GitHub](https://github.com/) to host our repositories, ensuring seamless teamwork and innovation.

**Version Control:** At its core, version control acts as our safety net, meticulously recording changes to a file or set of files over time. This allows us to revisit specific versions whenever necessary, facilitating a smooth development process and enabling effective progress tracking.

Other version control systems include [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/), [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), and [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/). However, Git has emerged as the industry standard due to its speed, data integrity, and distributed nature.

**Repository (Repo):** A repository serves as the designated home for our projects. It can be a local folder on your computer or a storage space on GitHub or another online host. Repositories can contain code files, text files, image files, and more, serving as the container for all components of our projects.

Popular repositories are: 

- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
