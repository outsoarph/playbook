## Introduction

At Outsoar, we strongly think that making software isn't something done alone—it's like playing on a team. In the complicated world of writing code, designing, and solving problems, working together is crucial for achieving great success. Collaboration is like the special key that helps us unlock amazing achievements.

Choosing and familiarizing yourself to a tool that helps you collaborate efficiently is a must. We use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and [GitHub](https://github.com/) for hosting our repositories.

## Definitions

**Version Control:** A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

**Repository:** A directory or storage space where your projects can live. Sometimes GitHub users shorten this to “repo.” It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, image files, you name it, inside a repository.
