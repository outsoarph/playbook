Git is a perfect example of this. Through the help of faster procedures and more smooth exchanges, decentralized techniques deliver considerable performance improvements.</p><p>Git has many benefits, such as accurate branching and merging, effective management of large repositories, and offline work support. Its flexibility and compatibility with various workflows make it a preferred choice for version control among software teams.</p><h2 id="what-is-git-and-how-it-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-git-and-how-it-works"><span>What is git and how it works?</span></a></h2><p>We&#39;re talking about Git, a decentralized version control system (DVCS) that we for tracking changes in source code during software development. Unlike centralized version control systems where there&#39;s a single central repository that holds all the code and its history, Git operates on a decentralized model where each developer has their own copy of the entire repository, including its full history.</p><p>Here&#39;s a step-by-step overview of how Git works:</p><p><strong>1. Initialize:</strong> Start by setting up a new Git repository in your project folder using</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code>$ <span class="token function">git</span> init
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p><strong>2. Add Files:</strong> Use git add to tell Git which files you want to track.</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code>$ <span class="token function">git</span> <span class="token function">add</span>
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p><strong>3. Commit Changes:</strong> Commit your changes with git commit to save a snapshot of your project.</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code>$ <span class="token function">git</span> commit
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p><strong>4. Create Branches:</strong> Use branches git branch to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main code.</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code>$ <span class="token function">git</span> branch
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p><strong>5. Merge Changes:</strong> Merge branches git merge back into the main code when ready.</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code>$ <span class="token function">git</span> merge
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p><strong>6. Collaborate:</strong> Share your changes by pushing git push them to a remote repository, like GitHub.</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code>$ <span class="token function">git</span> push
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p><strong>7. Sync Changes:</strong> Pull git pull changes from the remote repository to keep your local copy up to date.</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code>$ <span class="token function">git</span> pull
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p><strong>8. Review History:</strong> Use git log to see a history of changes and git diff to compare versions.</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code>$ <span class="token function">git</span> <span class="token function">diff</span>
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p><strong>9. Resolve Conflicts:</strong> If there are conflicting changes, Git helps you resolve them.</p><p><strong>10. Keep Improving:</strong> Use Git to continuously improve your project, collaborating with others and making changes confidently.</p><h2 id="version-control-with-git" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#version-control-with-git"><span>Version control with Git</span></a></h2><h4 id="why-git-is-industry-standard-for-version-control" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-git-is-industry-standard-for-version-control"><span><strong>Why git is industry standard for version control?</strong></span></a></h4><p>Git is the industry standard for version control since it&#39;s fast, flexible, and widely adopted. It gives developers their own space to work, makes experimenting with new features easy, and works reliably even with large projects. Plus, it&#39;s supported by popular platforms like GitHub and GitLab, and it&#39;s constantly evolving thanks to its open-source nature. In short, Git is the primary tool for managing code changes efficiently. Git is used to handle nearly all project source code at Outsoar, highlighting its essential function in successful code management.</p>`,28),h={href:"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/version-control-best-practices/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},g=a('<blockquote><p>Using Git best practices, teams can coordinate all changes in a software project and utilize fast branching to help teams quickly collaborate and share feedback, leading to immediate, actionable changes.</p></blockquote><h4 id="why-you-should-learn-git" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-you-should-learn-git"><span><strong>Why you should learn git?</strong></span></a></h4><p>As an example, let&#39;s take a look at Juna, a developer who is working on a web application feature. Juna can test the functionality without affecting the main codebase by using Git to create a new branch. Her changes can be easily merged back into the main branch if they operate properly. Should that not be the case, she can throw away the branch without messing with the project. Its control and flexibility allow developers such as Juna to confidently experiment and create.</p><p>We all need to learn Git in software development. It&#39;s highly valued by employers and essential for effective collaboration, change tracking, and conflict resolution. Git skills also empower us to contribute to open-source projects, showcase our work, and follow industry best practices.
